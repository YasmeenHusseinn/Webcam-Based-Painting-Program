Region finder is implemented using a region-growing algorithm that finds continuous points that are similar to the target color. It loops through every pixel in the image and does a flood-fill operation by visiting neighbors with similar colors. colorMatch makes sure that they are similar colors based on the maxColorDiff parameter. findRegions find regions that match the target color and the largestRegion method returns the largest region based on the number of points. The parameters used were maxColorDiff and minRegion. maxColorDiff allows for slight differences in color while minRegion allows for size changes. 

Region growing is useful as it can help clearly separate sections of an image by color. However, it is not very accurate as a slight change in light, texture, or movement might cause irregularities which leaves the image not colored correctly.
